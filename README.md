# Hi, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher motivated by challenging questions at the intersection of climate dynamics, water management, data science, and decision science and their real-world implications.

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar with the [Keller Group](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"} at the Penn State [Earth and Environmental Systems Institute](https://www.eesi.psu.edu/people){:target="_blank"} and a member of the [Penn State Initiative for Resilient Communities](https://www.psirc.psu.edu/){:target="_blank"} and NOAA [Mid-Atlantic Regional Integrated Science and Assessments](https://www.marisa.psu.edu/){:target="_blank"} teams.
My current projects develop conceptual and computational frameworks that integrate hard and soft instruments for adaptive flood risk management.
Prior to joining the Keller Group I was a graduate research fellow at the [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu){:target="_blank"}.
In January 2021 I will join the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Rice University as an assistant professor.

I completed my Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia and hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Yale University.
My Ph.D. dissertation, advised by [Upmanu Lall](http://www.columbia.edu/~ula2/){:target="_blank"}, develops methods for understanding and predicting spatiotemporally clustered hydroclimate risk, and for incorporating uncertain projections into sequential decision problems.

If I'm not in the office, you can probably find me watching [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja?lang=en){:target="_blank"}, [A.S. Roma](https://www.chiesaditotti.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Sportivo LuqueÃ±o](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/){:target="_blank"} or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php){:target="_blank"} is the truth.
