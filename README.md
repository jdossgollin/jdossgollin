# Hi, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently an assistant professor in the department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/people/faculty) at Rice University.
My research integrates earth science, data science, and decision science to support the design of flexible and adaptive infrastructure systems.

Before joining Rice I was a postdoctoral scholar with the [Keller Group](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/) at the Penn State [Earth and Environmental Systems Institute](https://www.eesi.psu.edu/people) and a PhD student at the [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu) in the department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia.

If I'm not in the office, you can probably find me watching [La Albirroja](https://twitter.com/albirroja), [A.S. Roma](https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/ASRomaEN), and [Sportivo LuqueÃ±o](http://clubsportivoluqueno.com.py/) or explaining why New Haven [apizza](https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/An-upcoming-film-celebrates-New-Haven-s-holy-12576171.php) is the truth.
